# CLAUDE.md

Laundry management web app — customers, orders, services, payments, analytics. Web only.
Bun workspace monorepo with `@laundry-app/shared` as the shared package (imported via `workspace:*`).

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Backend**: Effect TypeScript (`@effect/platform-bun`, `@effect/sql-pg`, `effect/Schema`)
- **Frontend**: TanStack Start (React), Tailwind CSS v4
- **Shared**: `@laundry-app/shared` — domain models shared between backend & frontend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (direct SQL, no ORM)
- **Auth**: JWT access tokens + refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies

## Documentation

Read these for detailed context:
- `docs/PRD.md` — Product requirements, API specs, frontend routes
- `docs/ADR_BACKEND.md` — Architecture decisions, database schema
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` — Effect patterns, service composition, middleware, layer setup
- Use available **skills** for framework-specific patterns (Effect, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, etc.)

## Dev Commands (from repo root)

- `bun run dev` — Start backend + frontend in parallel
- `bun run build` — Build both
- `bun run typecheck` — Type-check both
- `bun run format` — Format both
- `bun run lint` — Lint frontend
- Backend tests: `cd backend && bun run test`
- Frontend tests: `cd frontend && bun run test`
- Migrations: `cd backend && bun run migrate:up` / `migrate:down`

## Coding Rules

1. **No `SELECT *`** — Always use explicit column lists in SQL queries. Use explicit `RETURNING` clauses too.
2. **Shared models in `packages/shared/`** — All request/response DTOs, branded IDs, and enums go in `packages/shared/src/`. Backend `domain/` contains error classes and re-exports shared types. Never define data models inside `usecase/`.
3. **Snake_case DB columns** — Domain model property names must match database column names exactly (`snake_case`).
4. **Typed errors** — Use domain-specific error classes (e.g., `CustomerNotFound`). The error handler middleware maps them to HTTP responses.

## Git Workflow

- **Never push directly to master** — always create a branch
- Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- Plans for non-trivial work go in `docs/plans/<NAME>_<DATE>.md`

## CLI Commands — Use RTK

Always use `rtk` instead of raw shell commands. RTK is a token-optimized CLI proxy that reduces verbose output by 60-90%, producing cleaner output for LLM consumption.

- Commands are automatically rewritten by the Claude Code hook (`git status` → `rtk git status`)
- For meta commands, call `rtk` directly: `rtk gain`, `rtk discover`
- Use `rtk proxy <cmd>` to bypass filtering when debugging

# Code Exploration — Use Serena

Always use Serena's semantic tools for code exploration instead of reading entire files or grepping.

- Use `get_symbols_overview` to understand file structure without reading the full file
- Use `find_symbol` with `include_body=True` to read only the symbols you need
- Use `find_referencing_symbols` to trace callers and dependencies
- Use Serena's symbolic editing tools (`replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`) for precise code modifications
- Only fall back to full file reads when symbolic tools are insufficient

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **laundry-app** (3363 symbols, 5055 relationships, 33 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/laundry-app/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/laundry-app/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/laundry-app/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/laundry-app/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/laundry-app/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
